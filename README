Plugins
-------

pbs_nodefile: generates the PBS NODEFILE contents using the torque wrapper and places it in
              a file under TMPDIR. Creates an entry in the job's environment pointing to This
			  file.
              Get pl script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SchedMD/slurm/master/contribs/torque/generate_pbs_nodefile.pl

Example
-------

plugstack.conf:

required /usr/lib64/slurm/pbs_nodefile.so command=/usr/libexec/slurm/wrapper/generate_pbs_nodefile

Cleanup
-------

The plugin does not do any cleanup. The PBS NODEFILE should be created in a location that
will be cleaned up, e.g., by the epilogue or by another plugin, for example spank-private-tmp.

Version
-------

Works with slurm 20.11, 22.05, 23.02
