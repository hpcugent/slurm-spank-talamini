Plugins
-------

pbs_nodefile: generates the PBS NODEFILE contents using the torque wrapper and places it in
              a file under TMPDIR. Creates an entry in the job's environment pointing to This
			  file.

Example
-------

plugstack.conf:

required /usr/lib64/slurm/pbs_nodefile.so command=/usr/libexec/slurm/wrapper/generate_pbs_nodefile

Cleanup
-------

The plugin does not do any cleanup. The PBS NODEFILE should be created in a location that
will be cleaned up, e.g., by the epilogue or by another plugin, for example spank-private-tmp.
